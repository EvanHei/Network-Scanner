## Guide

### Scan Output

After running the script, youâ€™ll see:

- Active devices on your local network
- IP address, MAC address, vendor name, hostname (if available)
- Detected open ports on common services (e.g., 80, 443, 9100)

### Device Tracking

Each device is stored in a local SQLite database to track network assests over time.

- **New Devices**: IPs/MACs seen for the first time
- **Left Devices**: Devices no longer found
- **Total Devices**: Running count across all scans

## Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Concurrency**: parallel port scanning
- **Networking**: ARP / IP addresses, DNS, ports
- **Database**: SQLite
- **OS**: Windows
